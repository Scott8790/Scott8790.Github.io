# Who Spends the Most Money Ordering on DoorDash? Surprising Insights from Marketing Campaign 6

As I sat down to analyze the data for my recent project, I couldn’t help but recall my own experience ordering takeout during the pandemic. Like many, I turned to food delivery apps for comfort and convenience. Little did I know then that I would be diving deep into the numbers behind those transactions! This project, aimed at assessing the success of DoorDash’s marketing campaign 6, revealed some surprising insights about who spends the most money and what trends emerged throughout the year. I used Excel to clean and analyze the data.

### Why THIS Project?
My motivation for this project stemmed from a desire to enhance my skills in Excel while exploring real-world marketing effectiveness. I’d always been intrigued by how different demographics respond to marketing efforts, and this project allowed me to look closely at spending habits based on age groups. What made it even more interesting was the chance to see the tangible impacts of a targeted campaign.

### What Readers Will Gain
By reading this article, you’ll gain insights into how successful marketing campaigns can influence consumer behavior across different age groups. You'll also learn about unexpected spending patterns, and I’ll share tips on how to analyze data for meaningful takeaways.

### Key Takeaways
- Marketing campaign 6 was successful across all age groups.
- The age group that spent the most total was 51-65 years old, but those aged 66+ ordered the most on average.
- New customer growth remained steady throughout the year.
- The biggest surprise? The 66+ age group was the top spender on average, which wasn’t what I initially expected.

### Dataset Details
The dataset I worked with included more than 2000 rows and 40 columns of data, provided to me from Kaggle. It covered various spending patterns before and after the marketing campaign. This dataset was perfect for my project since it allowed for a robust comparison across age demographics and provided enough data points to draw meaningful insights.

### Analysis Process
I started with data cleaning to ensure accuracy, followed by transformation to categorize the data effectively. Using Excel pivot tables, I could visualize spending trends across age groups. What surprised me was the significant increase in spending from campaign 6—especially among the younger demographic (ages 24-35).

I also noticed trends in new customer registrations. January saw a spike, likely from gift card redemptions after the holidays, while March was a bit of a mystery. Perhaps DoorDash was running promotions that caught people's attention!

### Visuals and Insights

The 1 indicates "yes for campaign6." The bottom table represents the average total spent by age group regardless of campaign.

Visual 1: Pivot Table of Average Spending by Age Group This table highlighted the total amount spent by each age group on DoorDash. When I filtered the data to isolate customers influenced by campaign 6, the average spending for all groups increased significantly. Surprisingly, the 24-35 age group led with nearly $1,118 spent for the year. This visual showcases the campaign's broad appeal and its effectiveness in engaging younger consumers.

Visual 2: Pivot Chart of New Customer Registrations The chart illustrated that most new customers registered in January and March. The January spike is understandable; many people likely signed up to use gift cards they received over the holidays. The March peak, however, prompted speculation about potential promotions that DoorDash may have offered, suggesting that seasonal marketing strategies can effectively drive engagement.

### Main Takeaways
Through this project, I learned that curiosity about data can lead to valuable insights. It's essential to dig deeper and explore trends to answer critical business questions effectively. Here are a few actionable insights:

- Always analyze data from multiple angles to uncover hidden patterns.
- Don’t shy away from using visuals; they can make complex data easier to understand.
- Consider external factors (like seasonal promotions) when assessing data trends.

### Conclusion and Personal Reflections
This project has been a journey of discovery for me. It is also my first! I faced challenges, particularly in navigating complex datasets, but overcoming these obstacles only strengthened my analytical skills. It was interesting to see how different age groups responded to marketing campaigns, and this experience has fueled my passion for data analysis even further. I now have a broader perspective on how businesses can leverage data to enhance their marketing strategies. I enjoy using Excel and want to continue learning it and more analysis techniques.

Pivot Tables and charts are super helpful in data analysis! I loved learning how to create and use them. Also, I learned to not be afraid to add to the data! It was necessary to add columns to the dataset in order to group the customers by age.
