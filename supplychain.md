## Supply Chain Analysis: Using Power BI to Gain Some Helpful Insights

### Why this Project?

I was assigned this project to analyze this company's order and shipment data. This was a great opportunity to get my hands on Power BI, a brand-new tool for me to use in this analysis. I am always curious and eager to learn new tools of the trade when it comes to data analysis so I was excited to jump into the data and make some charts. The stakeholders wanted to know what made the company the most money and where the late deliveries were happening. They also wanted some suggestions on lowering the late deliveries.

### Key Insights and Takeaways
- Fishing items made the most profit overall based on quantity
- Computers were by far the most profitable item per order on average
- If a shipment took 4 days or longer it was late on average
- Latin America and Europe had the most late deliveries



### The Data
The data from this project can be found [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/5). It consists of more than 50 columns and more than 180,000 rows! This was a very rich dataset that had plenty of customer and order information. This happened to be real data used by DataCo Global and then they were later acquired by another company. It was extra fun working with real-life data!

### Analysis and Visualizations
It is very interesting to me to analyze the differences between sums and averages for different data points. I think it is crucial to analyze both because they tell different stories.

This bar chart represents the sum of total profit for every order. This takes into account the quantity of orders for all items within the category. This is important to note. This basically means that fishing products sell the most from this company. Look at the chart, it is pretty significantly higher than the other top categories. This tells me the company is efficient in selling fishing products and should continue to do so to maintain a strong revenue stream. Pay attention to this next bar chart as it will look similar but it is very different.

The axes are basically the same as before but notice the "Average" as compared to the "Sum" before. See how different the top categories are now? This bar chart shows computers are the highest profitable item per order on AVERAGE. Fishing fell to the fifth spot on this chart and cleats are not even visible here without scrolling. This tells me that computers generate the most profit per order on average on an individual item basis. In other words, if the company were to only sell one thing what should it be? Well, computers are the answer to that question. It more than doubles any category before it! They may sell fewer computers than they do fishing equipment, but they make more profit per item per order on average with computers.

Now it is time to help the stakeholders figure out where their late deliveries are coming from. The data had some interesting columns that helped paint this picture. I took the delivery status data from orders and compared it to the actual average shipment time in days.

This chart states that if a shipment is going to take four days or longer, it will be late on average. The company needs to explore some different shipping options to ensure that most of its shipments will be delivered in three days or less to ensure on-time delivery. More deliveries on time mean more business generated and will maintain happy customers and repeat business. The company must take this matter seriously.

Here is a chart that breaks down the late deliveries by the different markets the company sells its products. This line chart shows the count of deliveries made to each market. Latin America and Europe have the most late deliveries. Latin America had 28044 late deliveries and Europe had 27743 late deliveries. If the company wants to continue doing business with these markets, they should definitely investigate what is causing the late deliveries. They are so much higher than the other markets. US and Canada for example, had 14138 late deliveries. That's basically half of the amount from Latin America and Europe.

### Conclusion
The company needed my help shedding some light on two main areas. The company wanted to know where they were making the most money and where were the late deliveries so the company could investigate and hopefully put an end to them. My data visualizations helped answer these concerns by showing fishing products and computers were their top performers in terms of profit. Fishing products are the bulk of the sales for the company but the company makes more money per item on computers. It would be highly recommended that resources be put in to maintain the current flow of these products and perhaps invest more money into them to encourage more sales and ingenuity for the top-performing items being sold. Maybe find better shipping rates with other manufacturers of fishing and computers that would be able to ship to our markets quicker. Maybe negotiate better terms for these products if purchased in bulk to help boost profits.

Now for the late deliveries. There is too much! My chart indicates that most of the deliveries are actually late! That is not good business! The stakeholders need to see this and act quickly to get their shipments to their destinations on time. The company should do everything in its power to make shipments in 3 days or less. This will ensure on-time delivery and overall better satisfaction for all parties involved. This will create better relationships with their vendors and manufacturers. Then this ultimately creates better relationships with the end customers as well! Happy customers come back to buy again and that is the ultimate goal for company success. 

Power BI is an amazing yet simple tool to use right away! It is surprisingly intuitive to navigate the various tools and options for business visualizations. I will continue to learn how to use it and get better with it. It is a great skill for any analyst to add to their tool belt!
