# Are Massachusetts high Schools Ready for Your Child's Future? Let's Find Out!

Recently, I found myself reflecting on my own journey through school and the importance of education. It got me wondering—are the high schools in Massachusetts truly prepping our kids for college? This curiosity sparked my project that dives deep into the college readiness of nearly one million students across 1,800 high schools in the state. This means that decisions regarding high school education affect one-seventh of the state's population, which is 6.985 million.

### Why THIS Project?

Why Massachusetts you may ask? Well because that's the dataset I was able to find and work with. Data is hard to come by sometimes. The youth of today will be the leaders of tomorrow, and I believe that the right education can shape a brighter future for them. My motivation came from a desire to ensure that our children receive the best possible education, preparing them for challenges ahead. I want to know that my future accountant or doctor is well-equipped with knowledge. After all, who wants someone with a third-grade math level managing their finances? This project feels special because it’s not just data; it’s about real lives and futures.

The state of Massachusetts asked me to analyze their education data. The Secretary of Education is exploring ways to increase college attendance, including investing in building more schools. One idea is to lower the average class size in hopes of boosting the percentage of students attending college. Using Tableau we have taken a deep dive into the data.

### What Readers Will Gain
In this article, I’ll share insights from my research on high school performance in Massachusetts. You’ll learn about graduation rates, class sizes, and how these factors influence college attendance. I hope you’ll walk away with a better understanding of the educational landscape and the challenges we face.

### Key Takeaways
- **Low Graduation Rates**: 36 high schools have graduation rates below 50%.
- **Ideal Class Sizes**: 10-20 students per class show the highest college attendance.
- **Math Test Challenges**: 25 districts scored under 50% on 4th-grade math tests.
- **Collaborative Solutions**: High-performing districts should support struggling ones.

### Dataset Details
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data) I used came from Kaggle and the Massachusetts Department of Education, covering 1,800 high schools and nearly 1 million students. Speicifically the data came from numerous reports from the DOE but everything was compiled on kaggle It was a rich source of information that allowed me to draw meaningful conclusions about student performance and preparedness for college.

### Analysis Process
I took several steps to analyze the data. First, I checked the data to ensure accuracy and that it was clean. Turns out when you pull data directly from government institutions, they are pretty clean and don't require much work done before analysis. Then, I visualized the findings using Tableau, creating bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts. Through my analysis, I was surprised to find that schools with smaller class sizes (specifically, fewer than 10 students) didn’t necessarily lead to higher college attendance rates, which challenged my initial assumptions.

**Bar Chart**: This visual represents high school graduation rates in Massachusetts. The red bars indicate schools with low graduation rates, and as you can see, a significant number are in the red zone. This raises a critical need for intervention, perhaps through incentives for better teachers or more resources for these schools.

**Scatter Plot**: Next, we see a scatter plot showing class sizes against college attendance rates. The most successful class sizes range from 10 to 20 students, seen where most points cluster. This suggests that keeping class sizes manageable could significantly impact student success.

**Line Chart**: Finally, the line chart illustrates average MCAS math test scores across school districts. The red line shows the threshold of 50%, and it’s alarming how many districts fall below this. This situation calls for collaboration between high-performing and struggling districts to share strategies for improvement.

### Main Takeaways
Education in high school is a significant factor in a child's future. The findings from my research indicate that performance metrics in schools should be a priority for parents when deciding where to live and raise their families. It’s crucial for us to advocate for better educational standards and push for improvements in our local schools. I would encourage parents to investigate the local schools and evaluate their performance before deciding to move in that area. There are good and bad schools everywhere, I am just emphasizing to do your research before making a big life decision like choosing where to live and where your kids will be going to school.

### Conclusion and Personal Reflections
Through this project, I learned a lot about the educational landscape in Massachusetts. The challenges were not just about statistics; they were about real students and the futures that are at stake. Too many of MA's schools are under performing when it comes to college readiness for their students. State officials should get together with leadership from top schools and districts to come up with some kind of improvement plan. Maybe they need to budget better for school funding? Maybe they are not getting enough funding? I would recommend utilizing the resources at their disposal before trying to build more schools. That would just worsen and hinder education funding. This project has deepened my appreciation for education and reinforced my commitment to advocating for better opportunities for all students.
